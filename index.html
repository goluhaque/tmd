        <p>The Manipal Diaries is a social networking platform which primarily aims to encourage interaction between students, faculty &amp; alumni of a college with the help of forums, threads, chats, bookmarking of people's diaries, dog-earing of various threads, along with features like up-voting and down-voting of threads. There is also a separate feature called In &amp; Around Manipal which at the present is optimized towards use by Manipalites only. This feature allows people to add, review and rate places like food joints, historical monuments, places to have fun like beaches or picnic spots, night-clubs/bars etc. which are in &amp; around Manipal. </p>

<p>The project was coded in Java(UI with the help of JAVA FX2). MySQL was used as the database. The entire project follows a rigorous mixture of OOP &amp; MVC system architecture. It also implements a custom single-user system focused caching solution (which can be modified without much difficulty for a multi-user based system).</p>

<p>The project was created by 3 students of Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal, India: Afzalul Haque (<a href="https://github.com/goluhaque" class="user-mention">@goluhaque</a>), Amrit Ayyar &amp; Tanay Agrawal. TMD was created as a project intended for a subject in the 2nd year/4th semester of our B.Tech curriculum in Information &amp; Communication Technology.</p>
